### Description

I attempted to create a haiku using eight of President Nelson's recent talks. I copied the text of all of President Nelson's October 2020 and April 2020 talks and pasted them in a text document. I then ran the supplied generation code in a loop 3 times. On the first run, it prints 3 words then a new line. On the second run it prints 4 words then a new line. On the third iteration, it prints 3 words again and a new line. Haikus generally have 5 syllables then 7Â  then 5. I used word count to approximate syllables, though it's not exact.

### Run
`make clean && make lab2 && ./main Pres-Nelson.txt`

### Output

Here are some of the best outcomes:
```
Many of you
will begin anew truly
to hear Him
```

```
My dear brothers
and sisters the world
over are enduring
```

```
My dear sisters
let us recall a
crucial turning point
```

```
This has been
restored He and His
Son hear us
```

```
Lord My beloved
brothers and sisters the
world to alleviate
```

```
the power of
God the Father and
His Son Jesus
```

I updated it to do 4 words, 5, then 4 to see if I could get closer to the traditional syllable pattern. It now seems to go over the limit more, but here are two of the best ones:
```
to study the message
of the gospel to learn
about Them and honor
```

```
for humankind is widely
known But its prime purpose
is to be connected
```
