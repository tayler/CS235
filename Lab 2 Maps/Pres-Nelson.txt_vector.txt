My
dear
brothers
and
sisters
what
a
joy
it
is
to
be
with
you
as
we
begin
the
th
Semiannual
General
Conference
of
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
I
love
joining
with
you
in
your
homes
or
wherever
you
are
to
listen
together
to
the
messages
of
prophets
seers
and
revelators
and
other
Church
leaders
How
grateful
we
are
for
the
technology
that
allows
us
to
be
connected
as
one
great
worldwide
gathering
of
disciples
of
Jesus
Christ
General
conference
last
April
was
viewed
by
more
people
than
any
preceding
it
and
we
have
every
expectation
that
will
happen
again
During
the
past
few
months
a
global
pandemic
raging
wildfires
and
other
natural
disasters
have
turned
our
world
upside
down
I
grieve
with
each
of
you
who
has
lost
a
loved
one
during
this
time
And
I
pray
for
all
who
are
currently
suffering
Meanwhile
the
work
of
the
Lord
is
steadily
moving
forward
Amid
social
distancing
face
masks
and
Zoom
meetings
we
have
learned
to
do
some
things
differently
and
some
even
more
effectively
Unusual
times
can
bring
unusual
rewards
Our
missionaries
and
mission
leaders
have
been
resourceful
resilient
and
truly
remarkable
Although
most
missionaries
have
had
to
find
new
creative
ways
to
do
their
work
many
missions
have
reported
doing
more
teaching
than
ever
We
had
to
close
temples
for
a
time
and
some
construction
projects
were
briefly
delayed
but
now
they
are
all
moving
forward
In
the
calendar
year

we
will
have
broken
ground
for

new
temples
Family
history
work
has
increased
exponentially
Many
new
wards
and
stakes
have
been
created
And
we
are
gratified
to
report
that
the
Church
has
provided
pandemic
humanitarian
aid
for

projects
in

countries
Increased
gospel
study
in
many
homes
is
resulting
in
stronger
testimonies
and
family
relationships
One
mother
wrote
We
feel
much
closer
to
our
children
and
grandchildren
now
that
we
gather
on
Zoom
every
Sunday
Each
takes
a
turn
giving
their
thoughts
on
Come
Follow
Me
Prayers
for
our
family
members
have
changed
because
we
better
understand
what
they
need
I
pray
that
we
as
a
people
are
using
this
unique
time
to
grow
spiritually
We
are
here
on
earth
to
be
tested
to
see
if
we
will
choose
to
follow
Jesus
Christ
to
repent
regularly
to
learn
and
to
progress
Our
spirits
long
to
progress
And
we
do
that
best
by
staying
firmly
on
the
covenant
path
Through
it
all
our
Heavenly
Father
and
His
Son
Jesus
Christ
love
us
They
care
for
us
They
and
Their
holy
angels
are
watching
over
us
I
know
that
is
true
As
we
gather
to
hear
the
words
the
Lord
has
inspired
His
servants
to
deliver
I
invite
you
to
ponder
a
promise
the
Lord
made
He
declared
that
whosoever
will
may
lay
hold
upon
the
word
of
God
which
is
quick
and
powerful
which
shall
divide
asunder
all
the
cunning

and
the
wiles
of
the
devil
and
lead
the
disciple
of
Christ
in
a
strait
and
narrow
course
I
pray
that
you
will
choose
to
lay
hold
upon
the
word
of
God
as
it
is
declared
during
this
general
conference
And
I
pray
that
you
may
feel
the
Lords
perfect
love
for
you
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenThis
has
been
an
unforgettable
evening
My
dear
sisters
I
am
honored
to
be
with
you
You
have
been
on
my
mind
so
often
during
these
past
few
months
You
are
more
than
eight
million
strong
You
have
not
only
the
numbers
but
the
spiritual
power
to
change
the
world
I
have
watched
you
doing
just
that
during
this
pandemic
Some
of
you
suddenly
found
yourselves
searching
for
scarce
supplies
or
a
new
job
Many
tutored
children
and
checked
on
neighbors
Some
welcomed
missionaries
home
earlier
than
expected
while
others
transformed
your
homes
into
missionary
training
centers
You
have
used
technology
to
connect
with
family
and
friends
to
minister
to
those
who
have
felt
isolated
and
to
study
Come
Follow
Me
with
others
You
have
found
new
ways
to
make
the
Sabbath
a
delight
And
you
have
made
protective
masksmillions
of
them
With
heartfelt
compassion
and
love
my
heart
goes
out
to
the
many
women
around
the
world
whose
loved
ones
have
died
We
weep
with
you
And
we
pray
for
you
We
praise
and
pray
for
all
who
work
tirelessly
to
safeguard
the
health
of
others
You
young
women
have
also
been
remarkable
Though
social
media
has
been
flooded
with
contention
many
of
you
have
found
ways
to
encourage
others
and
share
our
Saviors
light
Sisters
you
have
all
been
absolutely
heroic
I
marvel
at
your
strength
and
your
faith
You
have
shown
that
in
difficult
circumstances
you
bravely
carry
on
I
love
you
and
I
assure
you
that
the
Lord
loves
you
and
sees
the
great
work
you
are
performing
Thank
you
Once
again
you
have
proven
that
you
are
literally
the
hope
of
Israel
You
embody
the
hopes
that
President
Gordon
B
Hinckley
had
for
you
when
he
introduced
The
Family
A
Proclamation
to
the
World

years
ago
in
the
September

general
Relief
Society
meeting
It
is
significant
that
he
chose
to
introduce
this
important
proclamation
to
the
sisters
of
the
Church
By
doing
so
President
Hinckley
underscored
the
irreplaceable
influence
of
women
in
the
Lords
plan
Now
I
would
love
to
know
what
you
have
learned
this
year
Have
you
grown
closer
to
the
Lord
or
do
you
feel
further
away
from
Him
And
how
have
current
events
made
you
feel
about
the
future
Admittedly
the
Lord
has
spoken
of
our
day
in
sobering
terms
He
warned
that
in
our
day
mens
hearts
would
fail
them
and
that
even
the
very
elect
would
be
at
risk
of
being
deceived
He
told
the
Prophet
Joseph
Smith
that
peace
would
be
taken
from
the
earth
and
calamities
would
befall
mankind
Yet
the
Lord
has
also
provided
a
vision
of
how
remarkable
this
dispensation
is
He
inspired
the
Prophet
Joseph
Smith
to
declare
that
the
work
of

these
last
days
is
one
of
vast
magnitude

Its
glories
are
past
description
and
its
grandeur
unsurpassable
Now
grandeur
may
not
be
the
word
you
would
choose
to
describe
these
past
few
months
How
are
we
to
deal
with
both
the
somber
prophecies
and
the
glorious
pronouncements
about
our
day
The
Lord
told
us
how
with
simple
but
stunning
reassurance
If
ye
are
prepared
ye
shall
not
fear
What
a
promise
It
is
one
that
can
literally
change
the
way
we
see
our
future
I
recently
heard
a
woman
of
deep
testimony
admit
that
the
pandemic
combined
with
an
earthquake
in
the
Salt
Lake
Valley
had
helped
her
realize
she
was
not
as
prepared
as
she
thought
she
was
When
I
asked
whether
she
was
referring
to
her
food
storage
or
her
testimony
she
smiled
and
said
Yes
If
preparation
is
our
key
to
embracing
this
dispensation
and
our
future
with
faith
how
can
we
best
prepare
For
decades
the
Lords
prophets
have
urged
us
to
store
food
water
and
financial
reserves
for
a
time
of
need
The
current
pandemic
has
reinforced
the
wisdom
of
that
counsel
I
urge
you
to
take
steps
to
be
temporally
prepared
But
I
am
even
more
concerned
about
your
spiritual
and
emotional
preparation
In
that
regard
we
can
learn
a
lot
from
Captain
Moroni
As
commander
of
the
Nephite
armies
he
faced
opposing
forces
that
were
stronger
greater
in
number
and
meaner
So
Moroni
prepared
his
people
in
three
essential
ways
First
he
helped
them
create
areas
where
they
would
be
safeplaces
of
security
he
called
them
Second
he
prepared
the
minds
of
the
people
to
be
faithful
unto
the
Lord
And
third
he
never
stopped
preparing
his
peoplephysically
or
spiritually
Let
us
consider
these
three
principles
Moroni
fortified
every
Nephite
city
with
embankments
forts
and
walls
When
the
Lamanites
came
against
them
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
because
of
the
wisdom
of
the
Nephites
in
preparing
their
places
of
security
Similarly
as
turmoil
rages
around
us
we
need
to
create
places
where
we
are
safe
both
physically
and
spiritually
When
your
home
becomes
a
personal
sanctuary
of
faithwhere
the
Spirit
residesyour
home
becomes
the
first
line
of
defense
Likewise
the
stakes
of
Zion
are
a
refuge
from
the
storm
because
they
are
led
by
those
who
hold
priesthood
keys
and
exercise
priesthood
authority
As
you
continue
to
follow
the
counsel
of
those
whom
the
Lord
has
authorized
to
guide
you
you
will
feel
greater
safety
The
templethe
house
of
the
Lordis
a
place
of
security
unlike
any
other
There
you
sisters
are
endowed
with
priesthood
power
through
the
sacred
priesthood
covenants
you
make
There
your
families
are
sealed
for
eternity
Even
this
year
when
access
to
our
temples
has
been
seriously
limited
your
endowment
has
given
you
constant
access
to
Gods
power
as
you
have
honored
your
covenants
with
Him
Simply
said
a
place
of
security
is
anywhere
you
can
feel
the
presence
of
the
Holy
Ghost
and
be
guided
by
Him
When
the
Holy
Ghost
is
with
you
you
can
teach
truth
even
when
it
runs
counter
to
prevailing
opinions
And
you
can
ponder
sincere
questions
about
the
gospel
in
an
environment
of
revelation
I
invite
you
my
dear
sisters
to
create
a
home
that
is
a
place
of
security
And
I
renew
my
invitation
for
you
to
increase
your
understanding
of
priesthood
power
and
of
temple
covenants
and
blessings
Having
places
of
security
to
which
you
can
retreat
will
help
you
embrace
the
future
with
faith
We
have
undertaken
a
major
project
to
extend
the
life
and
capacity
of
the
Salt
Lake
Temple
Salt
Lake
Temple
Some
questioned
the
need
for
taking
such
extraordinary
measures
However
when
the
Salt
Lake
Valley
suffered
a
magnitude
earthquake
earlier
this
year
this
venerable
temple
shook
hard
enough
that
the
trumpet
on
the
statue
of
the
angel
Moroni
fell
Statue
of
Moroni
Just
as
the
physical
foundation
of
the
Salt
Lake
Temple
must
be
strong
enough
to
withstand
natural
disasters
our
spiritual
foundations
must
be
solid
Then
when
metaphorical
earthquakes
rock
our
lives
we
can
stand
steadfast
and
immovable
because
of
our
faith
The
Lord
taught
us
how
to
increase
our
faith
by
seeking
learning
even
by
study
and
also
by
faith
We
strengthen
our
faith
in
Jesus
Christ
as
we
strive
to
keep
His
commandments
and
always
remember
him
Further
our
faith
increases
every
time
we
exercise
our
faith
in
Him
That
is
what
learning
by
faith
means
For
example
each
time
we
have
the
faith
to
be
obedient
to
Gods
lawseven
when
popular
opinions
belittle
usor
each
time
we
resist
entertainment
or
ideologies
that
celebrate
covenantbreaking
we
are
exercising
our
faith
which
in
turn
increases
our
faith
Further
few
things
build
faith
more
than
does
regular
immersion
in
the
Book
of
Mormon
No
other
book
testifies
of
Jesus
Christ
with
such
power
and
clarity
Its
prophets
as
inspired
by
the
Lord
saw
our
day
and
selected
the
doctrine
and
truths
that
would
help
us
most
The
Book
of
Mormon
is
our
latterday
survival
guide
Of
course
our
ultimate
security
comes
as
we
yoke
ourselves
to
Heavenly
Father
and
Jesus
Christ
Life
without
God
is
a
life
filled
with
fear
Life
with
God
is
a
life
filled
with
peace
This
is
because
spiritual
blessings
come
to
the
faithful
Receiving
personal
revelation
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
those
blessings
The
Lord
has
promised
that
if
we
will
ask
we
may
receive
revelation
upon
revelation
I
promise
that
as
you
increase
your
capacity
to
receive
revelation
the
Lord
will
bless
you
with
increased
direction
for
your
life
and
with
boundless
gifts
of
the
Spirit
Even
when
things
went
well
Captain
Moroni
continued
to
prepare
his
people
He
never
stopped
He
never
became
complacent
The
adversary
never
stops
attacking
So
we
can
never
stop
preparing
The
more
selfreliant
we
aretemporally
emotionally
and
spirituallythe
more
prepared
we
are
to
thwart
Satans
relentless
assaults
Dear
sisters
you
are
adept
at
creating
places
of
security
for
yourselves
and
those
you
love
Further
you
have
a
divine
endowment
that
enables
you
to
build
faith
in
others
in
compelling
ways
And
you
never
stop
You
have
demonstrated
that
once
again
this
year
Please
keep
going
Your
vigilance
in
safeguarding
your
homes
and
instilling
faith
in
the
hearts
of
your
loved
ones
will
reap
rewards
for
generations
to
come
My
dear
sisters
we
have
so
much
to
look
forward
to
The
Lord
placed
you
here
now
because
He
knew
you
had
the
capacity
to
negotiate
the
complexities
of
the
latter
part
of
these
latter
days
He
knew
you
would
grasp
the
grandeur
of
His
work
and
be
eager
to
help
bring
it
to
pass
I
am
not
saying
that
the
days
ahead
will
be
easy
but
I
promise
you
that
the
future
will
be
glorious
for
those
who
are
prepared
and
who
continue
to
prepare
to
be
instruments
in
the
Lords
hands
My
dear
sisters
let
us
not
just
endure
this
current
season
Let
us
embrace
the
future
with
faith
Turbulent
times
are
opportunities
for
us
to
thrive
spiritually
They
are
times
when
our
influence
can
be
much
more
penetrating
than
in
calmer
times
I
promise
that
as
we
create
places
of
security
prepare
our
minds
to
be
faithful
to
God
and
never
stop
preparing
God
will
bless
us
He
will
deliver
us
yea
insomuch
that
he
will
speak
peace
to
our
souls
and
will
grant
unto
us
great
faith
and

cause
us
that
we
can
hope
for
our
deliverance
in
him
As
you
prepare
to
embrace
the
future
with
faith
these
promises
will
be
yours
I
so
testify
with
my
expression
of
love
for
you
and
my
confidence
in
you
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenMy
dear
brothers
and
sisters
how
grateful
I
am
for
the
marvelous
messages
of
this
conference
and
for
my
privilege
to
speak
with
you
now
For
the
more
than

years
Ive
been
an
Apostle
the
doctrine
of
the
gathering
of
Israel
has
captured
my
attention
Everything
about
it
has
intrigued
me
including
the
ministries
and
names
of
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
their
lives
and
their
wives
the
covenant
God
made
with
them
and
extended
through
their
lineage
the
dispersion
of
the
twelve
tribes
and
the
numerous
prophecies
about
the
gathering
in
our
day
I
have
studied
the
gathering
prayed
about
it
feasted
upon
every
related
scripture
and
asked
the
Lord
to
increase
my
understanding
So
imagine
my
delight
when
I
was
led
recently
to
a
new
insight
With
the
help
of
two
Hebrew
scholars
I
learned
that
one
of
the
Hebraic
meanings
of
the
word
Israel
is
let
God
prevail
Thus
the
very
name
of
Israel
refers
to
a
person
who
is
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
his
or
her
life
That
concept
stirs
my
soul
The
word
willing
is
crucial
to
this
interpretation
of
Israel
We
all
have
our
agency
We
can
choose
to
be
of
Israel
or
not
We
can
choose
to
let
God
prevail
in
our
lives
or
not
We
can
choose
to
let
God
be
the
most
powerful
influence
in
our
lives
or
not
For
a
moment
let
us
recall
a
crucial
turning
point
in
the
life
of
Jacob
the
grandson
of
Abraham
At
the
place
Jacob
named
Peniel
which
means
the
face
of
God
Jacob
wrestled
with
a
serious
challenge
His
agency
was
tested
Through
this
wrestle
Jacob
proved
what
was
most
important
to
him
He
demonstrated
that
he
was
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
his
life
In
response
God
changed
Jacobs
name
to
Israel
meaning
let
God
prevail
God
then
promised
Israel
that
all
the
blessings
that
had
been
pronounced
upon
Abrahams
head
would
also
be
his
Sadly
Israels
posterity
broke
their
covenants
with
God
They
stoned
the
prophets
and
were
not
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
their
lives
Subsequently
God
scattered
them
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
Mercifully
He
later
promised
to
gather
them
as
reported
by
Isaiah
For
a
small
moment
have
I
forsaken
thee
Israel
but
with
great
mercies
will
I
gather
thee
With
the
Hebraic
definition
of
Israel
in
mind
we
find
that
the
gathering
of
Israel
takes
on
added
meaning
The
Lord
is
gathering
those
who
are
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
their
lives
The
Lord
is
gathering
those
who
will
choose
to
let
God
be
the
most
important
influence
in
their
lives
For
centuries
prophets
have
foretold
this
gathering
and
it
is
happening
right
now
As
an
essential
prelude
to
the
Second
Coming
of
the
Lord
it
is
the
most
important
work
in
the
world
This
premillennial
gathering
is
an
individual
saga
of
expanding
faith
and
spiritual
courage
for
millions
of
people
And
as
members
of
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
or
latterday
covenant
Israel
we
have
been
charged
to
assist
the
Lord
with
this
pivotal
work
When
we
speak
of
gathering
Israel
on
both
sides
of
the
veil
we
are
referring
of
course
to
missionary
temple
and
family
history
work
We
are
also
referring
to
building
faith
and
testimony
in
the
hearts
of
those
with
whom
we
live
work
and
serve
Anytime
we
do
anything
that
helps
anyoneon
either
side
of
the
veilto
make
and
keep
their
covenants
with
God
we
are
helping
to
gather
Israel
Not
long
ago
the
wife
of
one
of
our
grandsons
was
struggling
spiritually
I
will
call
her
Jill
Despite
fasting
prayer
and
priesthood
blessings
Jills
father
was
dying
She
was
gripped
with
fear
that
she
would
lose
both
her
dad
and
her
testimony
Late
one
evening
my
wife
Sister
Wendy
Nelson
told
me
of
Jills
situation
The
next
morning
Wendy
felt
impressed
to
share
with
Jill
that
my
response
to
her
spiritual
wrestle
was
one
word
The
word
was
myopic
Jill
later
admitted
to
Wendy
that
initially
she
was
devastated
by
my
response
She
said
I
was
hoping
for
Grandfather
to
promise
me
a
miracle
for
my
dad
I
kept
wondering
why
the
word
myopic
was
the
one
he
felt
compelled
to
say
After
Jills
father
passed
on
the
word
myopic
kept
coming
to
her
mind
She
opened
her
heart
to
understand
even
more
deeply
that
myopic
meant
nearsighted
And
her
thinking
began
to
shift
Jill
then
said
Myopic
caused
me
to
stop
think
and
heal
That
word
now
fills
me
with
peace
It
reminds
me
to
expand
my
perspective
and
seek
the
eternal
It
reminds
me
that
there
is
a
divine
plan
and
that
my
dad
still
lives
and
loves
and
looks
out
for
me
Myopic
has
led
me
to
God
I
am
very
proud
of
our
precious
granddaughterinlaw
During
this
heartwrenching
time
in
her
life
dear
Jill
is
learning
to
embrace
Gods
will
for
her
dad
with
an
eternal
perspective
for
her
own
life
By
choosing
to
let
God
prevail
she
is
finding
peace
If
we
will
allow
it
there
are
many
ways
this
Hebraic
interpretation
of
Israel
can
help
us
Imagine
how
our
prayers
for
our
missionariesand
for
our
own
efforts
to
gather
Israelcould
change
with
this
concept
in
mind
We
often
pray
that
we
and
the
missionaries
will
be
led
to
those
who
are
prepared
to
receive
the
truths
of
the
restored
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
I
wonder
to
whom
will
we
be
led
when
we
plead
to
find
those
who
are
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
their
lives
We
may
be
led
to
some
who
have
never
believed
in
God
or
Jesus
Christ
but
who
are
now
yearning
to
learn
about
Them
and
Their
plan
of
happiness
Others
may
have
been
born
in
the
covenant
but
have
since
wandered
away
from
the
covenant
path
They
may
now
be
ready
to
repent
return
and
let
God
prevail
We
can
assist
them
by
welcoming
them
with
open
arms
and
hearts
And
some
to
whom
we
may
be
led
may
have
always
felt
there
was
something
missing
in
their
lives
They
too
are
longing
for
the
wholeness
and
joy
that
come
to
those
who
are
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
their
lives
The
gospel
net
to
gather
scattered
Israel
is
expansive
There
is
room
for
each
person
who
will
fully
embrace
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
Each
convert
becomes
one
of
Gods
covenant
children
whether
by
birth
or
by
adoption
Each
becomes
a
full
heir
to
all
that
God
has
promised
the
faithful
children
of
Israel
Each
of
us
has
a
divine
potential
because
each
is
a
child
of
God
Each
is
equal
in
His
eyes
The
implications
of
this
truth
are
profound
Brothers
and
sisters
please
listen
carefully
to
what
I
am
about
to
say
God
does
not
love
one
race
more
than
another
His
doctrine
on
this
matter
is
clear
He
invites
all
to
come
unto
Him
black
and
white
bond
and
free
male
and
female
I
assure
you
that
your
standing
before
God
is
not
determined
by
the
color
of
your
skin
Favor
or
disfavor
with
God
is
dependent
upon
your
devotion
to
God
and
His
commandments
and
not
the
color
of
your
skin
I
grieve
that
our
Black
brothers
and
sisters
the
world
over
are
enduring
the
pains
of
racism
and
prejudice
Today
I
call
upon
our
members
everywhere
to
lead
out
in
abandoning
attitudes
and
actions
of
prejudice
I
plead
with
you
to
promote
respect
for
all
of
Gods
children
The
question
for
each
of
us
regardless
of
race
is
the
same
Are
you
willing
to
let
God
prevail
in
your
life
Are
you
willing
to
let
God
be
the
most
important
influence
in
your
life
Will
you
allow
His
words
His
commandments
and
His
covenants
to
influence
what
you
do
each
day
Will
you
allow
His
voice
to
take
priority
over
any
other
Are
you
willing
to
let
whatever
He
needs
you
to
do
take
precedence
over
every
other
ambition
Are
you
willing
to
have
your
will
swallowed
up
in
His
Consider
how
such
willingness
could
bless
you
If
you
are
unmarried
and
seeking
an
eternal
companion
your
desire
to
be
of
Israel
will
help
you
decide
whom
to
date
and
how
If
you
are
married
to
a
companion
who
has
broken
his
or
her
covenants
your
willingness
to
let
God
prevail
in
your
life
will
allow
your
covenants
with
God
to
remain
intact
The
Savior
will
heal
your
broken
heart
The
heavens
will
open
as
you
seek
to
know
how
to
move
forward
You
do
not
need
to
wander
or
wonder
If
you
have
sincere
questions
about
the
gospel
or
the
Church
as
you
choose
to
let
God
prevail
you
will
be
led
to
find
and
understand
the
absolute
eternal
truths
that
will
guide
your
life
and
help
you
stay
firmly
on
the
covenant
path
When
you
are
faced
with
temptationeven
if
the
temptation
comes
when
you
are
exhausted
or
feeling
alone
or
misunderstoodimagine
the
courage
you
can
muster
as
you
choose
to
let
God
prevail
in
your
life
and
as
you
plead
with
Him
to
strengthen
you
When
your
greatest
desire
is
to
let
God
prevail
to
be
part
of
Israel
so
many
decisions
become
easier
So
many
issues
become
nonissues
You
know
how
best
to
groom
yourself
You
know
what
to
watch
and
read
where
to
spend
your
time
and
with
whom
to
associate
You
know
what
you
want
to
accomplish
You
know
the
kind
of
person
you
really
want
to
become
Now
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
it
takes
both
faith
and
courage
to
let
God
prevail
It
takes
persistent
rigorous
spiritual
work
to
repent
and
to
put
off
the
natural
man
through
the
Atonement
of
Jesus
Christ
It
takes
consistent
daily
effort
to
develop
personal
habits
to
study
the
gospel
to
learn
more
about
Heavenly
Father
and
Jesus
Christ
and
to
seek
and
respond
to
personal
revelation
During
these
perilous
times
of
which
the
Apostle
Paul
prophesied
Satan
is
no
longer
even
trying
to
hide
his
attacks
on
Gods
plan
Emboldened
evil
abounds
Therefore
the
only
way
to
survive
spiritually
is
to
be
determined
to
let
God
prevail
in
our
lives
to
learn
to
hear
His
voice
and
to
use
our
energy
to
help
gather
Israel
Now
how
does
the
Lord
feel
about
people
who
will
let
God
prevail
Nephi
summed
it
up
well
The
Lord
loveth
those
who
will
have
him
to
be
their
God
Behold
he
loved
our
fathers
and
he
covenanted
with
them
yea
even
Abraham
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
he
remembers
the
covenants
which
he
has
made
And
what
is
the
Lord
willing
to
do
for
Israel
The
Lord
has
pledged
that
He
will
fight
our
battles
and
our
childrens
battles
and
our
childrens
childrens
battles

to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
As
you
study
your
scriptures
during
the
next
six
months
I
encourage
you
to
make
a
list
of
all
that
the
Lord
has
promised
He
will
do
for
covenant
Israel
I
think
you
will
be
astounded
Ponder
these
promises
Talk
about
them
with
your
family
and
friends
Then
live
and
watch
for
these
promises
to
be
fulfilled
in
your
own
life
My
dear
brothers
and
sisters
as
you
choose
to
let
God
prevail
in
your
lives
you
will
experience
for
yourselves
that
our
God
is
a
God
of
miracles
As
a
people
we
are
His
covenant
children
and
we
will
be
called
by
His
name
Of
this
I
testify
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenMy
dear
brothers
and
sisters
these
two
days
of
general
conference
have
been
glorious
I
agree
with
Elder
Jeffrey
R
Holland
As
he
mentioned
the
messages
the
prayers
and
the
music
have
all
been
inspired
by
the
Lord
I
am
grateful
to
all
who
have
participated
in
any
way
Throughout
the
proceedings
I
have
pictured
you
in
my
mind
listening
to
conference
I
have
asked
the
Lord
to
help
me
understand
what
you
are
feeling
worrying
about
or
trying
to
resolve
I
have
wondered
what
I
might
say
to
conclude
this
conference
that
would
send
you
forth
with
the
optimism
about
the
future
that
I
know
the
Lord
wants
you
to
feel
We
live
in
a
glorious
age
foreseen
by
prophets
for
centuries
This
is
the
dispensation
when
no
spiritual
blessing
will
be
withheld
from
the
righteous
Despite
the
worlds
commotion
the
Lord
would
have
us
look
forward
to
the
future
with
joyful
anticipation
Let
us
not
spin
our
wheels
in
the
memories
of
yesterday
The
gathering
of
Israel
moves
forward
The
Lord
Jesus
Christ
directs
the
affairs
of
His
Church
and
it
will
achieve
its
divine
objectives
The
challenge
for
you
and
me
is
to
make
certain
that
each
of
us
will
achieve
his
or
her
divine
potential
Today
we
often
hear
about
a
new
normal
If
you
really
want
to
embrace
a
new
normal
I
invite
you
to
turn
your
heart
mind
and
soul
increasingly
to
our
Heavenly
Father
and
His
Son
Jesus
Christ
Let
that
be
your
new
normal
Embrace
your
new
normal
by
repenting
daily
Seek
to
be
increasingly
pure
in
thought
word
and
deed
Minister
to
others
Keep
an
eternal
perspective
Magnify
your
callings
And
whatever
your
challenges
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
live
each
day
so
that
you
are
more
prepared
to
meet
your
Maker
That
is
why
we
have
temples
The
Lords
ordinances
and
covenants
prepare
us
for
eternal
life
the
greatest
of
all
of
Gods
blessings
As
you
know
the
COVID
pandemic
required
a
temporary
closure
of
our
temples
Then
we
commenced
a
carefully
coordinated
phased
reopening
With
phase

now
in
place
in
many
temples
thousands
of
couples
have
been
sealed
and
thousands
have
received
their
own
endowments
just
in
the
past
few
months
We
look
forward
to
the
day
when
all
worthy
members
of
the
Church
can
again
serve
their
ancestors
and
worship
in
a
holy
temple
Now
I
am
pleased
to
announce
plans
for
the
construction
of
six
new
temples
to
be
built
in
the
following
locations
Tarawa
Kiribati
Port
Vila
Vanuatu
Lindon
Utah
Greater
Guatemala
City
Guatemala
So
Paulo
East
Brazil
and
Santa
Cruz
Bolivia
As
we
build
and
maintain
these
temples
we
pray
that
each
of
you
will
build
and
maintain
yourself
so
you
can
be
worthy
to
enter
the
holy
temple
Now
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
I
bless
you
to
be
filled
with
the
peace
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
His
peace
is
beyond
all
mortal
understanding
I
bless
you
with
an
increased
desire
and
ability
to
obey
the
laws
of
God
I
promise
that
as
you
do
you
will
be
showered
with
blessings
including
greater
courage
increased
personal
revelation
sweeter
harmony
in
your
homes
and
joy
even
amid
uncertainty
May
we
go
forward
together
to
fulfill
our
divine
mandatethat
of
preparing
ourselves
and
the
world
for
the
Second
Coming
of
the
Lord
I
so
pray
with
my
expression
of
love
for
you
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenMy
beloved
brothers
and
sisters
as
we
welcome
you
to
this
historic
April

general
conference
of
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
for
reasons
you
know
I
stand
before
you
in
an
empty
auditorium
Little
did
I
know
when
I
promised
you
at
the
October

general
conference
that
this
April
conference
would
be
memorable
and
unforgettable
that
speaking
to
a
visible
congregation
of
fewer
than

people
would
make
this
conference
so
memorable
and
unforgettable
for
me
Yet
the
knowledge
that
you
are
participating
by
electronic
transmission
and
the
choirs
beautiful
rendition
of
It
Is
Well
with
My
Soul
bring
great
comfort
to
my
soul
As
you
know
attendance
at
this
general
conference
has
been
strictly
limited
as
part
of
our
efforts
to
be
good
global
citizens
and
do
all
we
can
to
limit
the
spread
of
COVID
This
virus
has
had
a
major
impact
throughout
the
world
It
has
also
altered
our
Church
meetings
missionary
service
and
temple
work
for
a
while
Though
todays
restrictions
relate
to
a
virulent
virus
lifes
personal
trials
stretch
far
beyond
this
pandemic
Future
trials
could
result
from
an
accident
a
natural
disaster
or
an
unexpected
personal
heartache
How
can
we
endure
such
trials
The
Lord
has
told
us
that
if
ye
are
prepared
ye
shall
not
fear
Of
course
we
can
store
our
own
reserves
of
food
water
and
savings
But
equally
crucial
is
our
need
to
fill
our
personal
spiritual
storehouses
with
faith
truth
and
testimony
Our
ultimate
quest
in
life
is
to
prepare
to
meet
our
Maker
We
do
this
by
striving
daily
to
become
more
like
our
Savior
Jesus
Christ
And
we
do
that
as
we
repent
daily
and
receive
His
cleansing
healing
and
strengthening
power
Then
we
can
feel
enduring
peace
and
joy
even
during
turbulent
times
This
is
exactly
why
the
Lord
has
implored
us
to
stand
in
holy
places
and
be
not
moved
This
year
we
commemorate
the
th
anniversary
of
one
of
the
most
significant
events
in
the
history
of
the
worldnamely
the
appearance
of
God
the
Father
and
His
Beloved
Son
Jesus
Christ
to
Joseph
Smith
During
that
singular
vision
God
the
Father
pointed
to
Jesus
Christ
and
said
This
is
My
Beloved
Son
Hear
Him
That
admonition
given
to
Joseph
is
for
each
of
us
We
are
to
seek
in
every
way
we
can
to
hear
Jesus
Christ
who
speaks
to
us
through
the
power
and
ministering
of
the
Holy
Ghost
The
purpose
of
this
and
every
general
conference
is
to
help
us
to
hear
Him
We
have
prayed
and
invite
you
to
pray
that
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
will
be
with
us
in
such
rich
abundance
that
you
can
hear
the
messages
that
the
Savior
has
especially
for
youmessages
that
will
bring
peace
to
your
soul
Messages
that
will
heal
your
broken
heart
Messages
that
will
illuminate
your
mind
Messages
that
will
help
you
know
what
to
do
as
you
move
ahead
through
times
of
turmoil
and
trial
We
pray
that
this
conference
will
be
memorable
and
unforgettable
because
of
the
messages
you
will
hear
the
unique
announcements
which
will
be
made
and
the
experiences
in
which
you
will
be
invited
to
participate
For
example
at
the
conclusion
of
the
Sunday
morning
session
we
will
convene
a
worldwide
solemn
assembly
when
I
will
lead
you
in
the
sacred
Hosanna
Shout
We
pray
that
this
will
be
a
spiritual
highlight
for
you
as
we
express
in
global
unison
our
profound
gratitude
to
God
the
Father
and
His
Beloved
Son
by
praising
Them
in
this
unique
way
For
this
sacred
experience
we
use
clean
white
handkerchiefs
But
if
you
do
not
have
one
you
may
simply
wave
your
hand
At
the
conclusion
of
the
Hosanna
Shout
the
congregation
will
join
with

The
Spirit
of
God
My
dear
brothers
and
sisters
this
conference
will
be
magnificent
This
year
will
be
extraordinary
as
we
focus
intently
on
the
Savior
and
His
restored
gospel
The
most
important
lasting
effects
of
this
historic
conference
will
be
as
our
hearts
change
and
we
commence
a
lifelong
quest
to
hear
Him
Welcome
to
April

general
conference
I
know
that
God
our
Heavenly
Father
and
His
Son
Jesus
Christ
are
mindful
of
us
They
will
be
with
us
throughout
the
proceedings
of
these
two
glorious
days
as
we
seek
to
draw
closer
to
Them
and
honor
Them
In
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenaction
What
a
unique
and
wonderful
session
this
has
been
Thank
you
dear
Laudy
and
Enzo
You
represented
the
magnificent
young
women
and
young
men
of
the
Church
so
very
well
My
dear
brothers
and
sisters
we
have
heard
much
today
about
the
Restoration
of
the
Churchthe
very
Church
that
our
Savior
Jesus
Christ
established
during
His
earthly
ministry
That
Restoration
began

years
ago
this
spring
when
God
the
Father
and
His
Son
Jesus
Christ
appeared
to
the
young
Joseph
Smith
Ten
years
after
this
transcendent
vision
the
Prophet
Joseph
Smith
and
five
others
were
called
as
founding
members
of
the
Lords
restored
Church
From
that
small
group
assembled
on
April


has
come
a
global
organization
of
more
than

million
members
The
good
this
Church
accomplishes
around
the
world
to
alleviate
human
suffering
and
provide
uplift
for
humankind
is
widely
known
But
its
prime
purpose
is
to
help
men
women
and
children
follow
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
keep
His
commandments
and
qualify
for
the
greatest
of
all
blessingsthat
of
eternal
life
with
God
and
their
loved
ones
As
we
commemorate
the
event
that
was
launched
in

it
is
important
to
remember
that
while
we
revere
Joseph
Smith
as
a
prophet
of
God
this
is
not
the
church
of
Joseph
Smith
nor
is
it
the
church
of
Mormon
This
is
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
He
decreed
exactly
what
His
Church
should
be
called
For
thus
shall
my
church
be
called
in
the
last
days
even
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
I
have
spoken
previously
about
a
needed
course
correction
in
the
way
we
refer
to
the
name
of
the
Church
Since
that
time
much
has
been
done
to
accomplish
this
correction
I
am
very
grateful
to
President
M
Russell
Ballard
and
the
entire
Quorum
of
the
Twelve
Apostles
who
have
done
so
much
to
lead
these
efforts
as
well
as
those
related
to
another
initiative
that
I
will
announce
this
evening
Church
leaders
and
departments
related
entities
and
millions
of
membersand
othersnow
use
the
correct
name
of
the
Church
The
Churchs
official
style
guide
has
been
adjusted
The
Churchs
principal
website
is
now
ChurchofJesusChristorg
Addresses
for
email
domain
names
and
social
media
channels
have
been
updated
Our
beloved
choir
is
now
the
Tabernacle
Choir
at
Temple
Square
We
have
gone
to
these
extraordinary
efforts
because
when
we
remove
the
Lords
name
from
the
name
of
His
Church
we
inadvertently
remove
Him
as
the
central
focus
of
our
worship
and
our
lives
When
we
take
the
Saviors
name
upon
us
at
baptism
we
commit
to
witness
by
our
words
thoughts
and
actions
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
Previously
I
promised
that
if
we
would
do
our
best
to
restore
the
correct
name
of
the
Lords
Church
He
would
pour
down
His
power
and
blessings
upon
the
heads
of
the
Latterday
Saints
the
likes
of
which
we
have
never
seen
I
renew
that
promise
today
To
help
us
remember
Him
and
to
identify
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
as
the
Lords
Church
we
are
pleased
to
introduce
a
symbol
that
will
signify
the
central
place
of
Jesus
Christ
in
His
Church
This
symbol
includes
the
name
of
the
Church
contained
within
a
cornerstone
Jesus
Christ
is
the
chief
cornerstone
At
the
center
of
the
symbol
is
a
representation
of
Thorvaldsens
marble
statue
the
Christus
It
portrays
the
resurrected
living
Lord
reaching
out
to
embrace
all
who
will
come
unto
Him
Symbolically
Jesus
Christ
is
standing
under
an
arch
The
arch
reminds
us
of
the
resurrected
Savior
emerging
from
the
tomb
on
the
third
day
following
His
Crucifixion
This
symbol
should
feel
familiar
to
many
as
we
have
long
identified
the
restored
gospel
with
the
living
resurrected
Christ
The
symbol
will
now
be
used
as
a
visual
identifier
for
official
literature
news
and
events
of
the
Church
It
will
remind
all
that
this
is
the
Saviors
Church
and
that
all
we
do
as
members
of
His
Church
centers
on
Jesus
Christ
and
His
gospel
Now
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
tomorrow
is
Palm
Sunday
as
Elder
Gong
has
so
eloquently
taught
Then
we
enter
the
special
week
that
culminates
with
Easter
As
followers
of
Jesus
Christ
living
in
a
day
when
the
COVID
pandemic
has
put
the
whole
world
in
commotion
let
us
not
just
talk
of
Christ
or
preach
of
Christ
or
employ
a
symbol
representing
Christ
Let
us
put
our
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
into
action
As
you
know
members
of
the
Church
observe
the
law
of
the
fast
one
day
each
month
The
doctrine
of
fasting
is
ancient
It
has
been
practiced
by
biblical
heroes
from
the
earliest
days
Moses
David
Ezra
Nehemiah
Esther
Isaiah
Daniel
Joel
and
many
others
fasted
and
preached
of
fasting
Through
Isaiahs
writings
the
Lord
said
Is
not
this
the
fast
that
I
have
chosen
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
The
Apostle
Paul
admonished
Saints
in
Corinth
to
give
yourselves
to
fasting
and
prayer
The
Savior
Himself
declared
that
certain
things
go
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
fasting
I
said
recently
in
a
social
media
video
that
as
a
physician
and
surgeon
I
have
great
admiration
for
medical
professionals
scientists
and
all
who
are
working
around
the
clock
to
curb
the
spread
of
COVID
Now
as
President
of
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
and
an
Apostle
of
Jesus
Christ
I
know
that
God
has
all
power
all
wisdom
and
all
understanding
he
comprehendeth
all
things
and
he
is
a
merciful
Being
even
unto
salvation
to
those
who
will
repent
and
believe
on
his
name
So
during
times
of
deep
distress
as
when
illness
reaches
pandemic
proportions
the
most
natural
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
call
upon
our
Heavenly
Father
and
His
Sonthe
Master
Healerto
show
forth
Their
marvelous
power
to
bless
the
people
of
the
earth
In
my
video
message
I
invited
all
to
join
in
fasting
on
Sunday
March


Many
of
you
may
have
seen
the
video
and
joined
in
the
fast
Some
may
have
not
Now
we
still
need
help
from
heaven
So
tonight
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
spirit
of
the
sons
of
Mosiah
who
gave
themselves
to
much
fasting
and
prayer
and
as
part
of
our
April

general
conference
I
am
calling
for
another
worldwide
fast
For
all
whose
health
may
permit
let
us
fast
pray
and
unite
our
faith
once
again
Let
us
prayerfully
plead
for
relief
from
this
global
pandemic
I
invite
all
including
those
not
of
our
faith
to
fast
and
pray
on
Good
Friday
April

that
the
present
pandemic
may
be
controlled
caregivers
protected
the
economy
strengthened
and
life
normalized
How
do
we
fast
Two
meals
or
a
period
of

hours
is
customary
But
you
decide
what
would
constitute
a
sacrifice
for
you
as
you
remember
the
supreme
sacrifice
the
Savior
made
for
you
Let
us
unite
in
pleading
for
healing
throughout
the
world
Good
Friday
would
be
the
perfect
day
to
have
our
Heavenly
Father
and
His
Son
hear
us
Dear
brothers
and
sisters
I
express
my
deep
love
for
you
along
with
my
testimony
of
the
divinity
of
the
work
in
which
we
are
engaged
This
is
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
He
stands
at
its
head
and
directs
all
that
we
do
I
know
that
He
will
respond
to
the
pleadings
of
His
people
I
so
testify
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenMy
dear
brothers
and
sisters
how
thankful
I
am
that
through
the
use
of
technology
we
have
been
able
to
meet
together
and
worship
on
this
Sunday
morning
How
blessed
we
are
to
know
that
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
has
been
restored
to
the
earth
In
the
past
several
weeks
most
of
us
have
experienced
disruptions
in
our
personal
lives
Earthquakes
fires
floods
plagues
and
their
aftermaths
have
disrupted
routines
and
caused
shortages
of
food
staples
and
savings
Amidst
all
of
this
we
commend
you
and
thank
you
for
choosing
to
hear
the
word
of
the
Lord
during
this
time
of
turmoil
by
joining
with
us
for
general
conference
The
increasing
darkness
that
accompanies
tribulation
makes
the
light
of
Jesus
Christ
shine
ever
brighter
Just
think
of
the
good
each
of
us
can
do
during
this
time
of
global
upheaval
Your
love
of
and
faith
in
the
Savior
may
very
well
be
the
catalyst
for
someone
to
discover
the
Restoration
of
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
In
the
past
two
years
Sister
Nelson
and
I
have
met
with
thousands
of
you
around
the
world
We
have
convened
with
you
in
outdoor
arenas
and
in
hotel
ballrooms
In
each
location
I
have
felt
that
I
was
in
the
presence
of
the
Lords
elect
and
that
I
was
seeing
the
gathering
of
Israel
occur
before
my
eyes
We
live
in
the
day
that
our
forefathers
have
awaited
with
anxious
expectation
We
have
frontrow
seats
to
witness
live
what
the
prophet
Nephi
saw
only
in
vision
that
the
power
of
the
Lamb
of
God
would
descend
upon
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
who
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
were
armed
with
righteousness
and
with
the
power
of
God
in
great
glory
You
my
brothers
and
sisters
are
among
those
men
women
and
children
whom
Nephi
saw
Think
of
that
Regardless
of
where
you
live
or
what
your
circumstances
are
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
is
your
Savior
and
Gods
prophet
Joseph
Smith
is
your
prophet
He
was
foreordained
before
the
foundation
of
the
earth
to
be
the
prophet
of
this
last
dispensation
when
nothing
shall
be
withheld
from
the
Saints
Revelation
continues
to
flow
from
the
Lord
during
this
ongoing
process
of
restoration
What
does
it
mean
for
you
that
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
has
been
restored
to
the
earth
It
means
that
you
and
your
family
can
be
sealed
together
forever
It
means
that
because
you
have
been
baptized
by
one
who
has
authority
from
Jesus
Christ
and
have
been
confirmed
a
member
of
His
Church
you
can
enjoy
the
constant
companionship
of
the
Holy
Ghost
He
will
guide
and
protect
you
It
means
you
will
never
be
left
comfortless
or
without
access
to
the
power
of
God
to
help
you
It
means
that
priesthood
power
can
bless
you
as
you
receive
essential
ordinances
and
make
covenants
with
God
and
keep
them
What
an
anchor
to
our
souls
are
these
truths
especially
during
these
times
when
the
tempest
is
raging
The
Book
of
Mormon
chronicles
the
classic
rise
and
fall
of
two
major
civilizations
Their
history
demonstrates
how
easy
it
is
for
a
majority
of
the
people
to
forget
God
reject
warnings
of
the
Lords
prophets
and
seek
power
popularity
and
pleasures
of
the
flesh
Repeatedly
past
prophets
have
declared
great
and
marvelous
things
unto
the
people
which
they
did
not
believe
It
is
no
different
in
our
day
Through
the
years
great
and
marvelous
things
have
been
heard
from
dedicated
pulpits
across
the
earth
Yet
most
people
do
not
embrace
these
truthseither
because
they
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
them
or
because
they
are
listening
to
those
who
do
not
have
the
whole
truth
or
because
they
have
rejected
truth
in
favor
of
worldly
pursuits
The
adversary
is
clever
For
millennia
he
has
been
making
good
look
evil
and
evil
look
good
His
messages
tend
to
be
loud
bold
and
boastful
However
messages
from
our
Heavenly
Father
are
strikingly
different
He
communicates
simply
quietly
and
with
such
stunning
plainness
that
we
cannot
misunderstand
Him
For
example
whenever
He
has
introduced
His
Only
Begotten
Son
to
mortals
upon
the
earth
He
has
done
so
with
remarkably
few
words
On
the
Mount
of
Transfiguration
to
Peter
James
and
John
God
said
This
is
my
beloved
Son
hear
him
His
words
to
the
Nephites
in
ancient
Bountiful
were
Behold
my
Beloved
Son
in
whom
I
am
well
pleased
in
whom
I
have
glorified
my
namehear
ye
him
And
to
Joseph
Smith
in
that
profound
declaration
that
opened
this
dispensation
God
simply
said
This
is
My
Beloved
Son
Hear
Him
Now
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
consider
the
fact
that
in
these
three
instances
just
mentioned
just
before
the
Father
introduced
the
Son
the
people
involved
were
in
a
state
of
fear
and
to
some
degree
desperation
The
Apostles
were
afraid
when
they
saw
Jesus
Christ
encircled
by
a
cloud
on
the
Mount
of
Transfiguration
The
Nephites
were
afraid
because
they
had
been
through
destruction
and
darkness
for
several
days
Joseph
Smith
was
in
the
grips
of
a
force
of
darkness
just
before
the
heavens
opened
Our
Father
knows
that
when
we
are
surrounded
by
uncertainty
and
fear
what
will
help
us
the
very
most
is
to
hear
His
Son
Because
when
we
seek
to
heartruly
hearHis
Son
we
will
be
guided
to
know
what
to
do
in
any
circumstance
The
very
first
word
in
the
Doctrine
and
Covenants
is
hearken
It
means
to
listen
with
the
intent
to
obey
To
hearken
means
to
hear
Himto
hear
what
the
Savior
says
and
then
to
heed
His
counsel
In
those
two
wordsHear
HimGod
gives
us
the
pattern
for
success
happiness
and
joy
in
this
life
We
are
to
hear
the
words
of
the
Lord
hearken
to
them
and
heed
what
He
has
told
us
As
we
seek
to
be
disciples
of
Jesus
Christ
our
efforts
to
hear
Him
need
to
be
ever
more
intentional
It
takes
conscious
and
consistent
effort
to
fill
our
daily
lives
with
His
words
His
teachings
His
truths
We
simply
cannot
rely
upon
information
we
bump
into
on
social
media
With
billions
of
words
online
and
in
a
marketingsaturated
world
constantly
infiltrated
by
noisy
nefarious
efforts
of
the
adversary
where
can
we
go
to
hear
Him
We
can
go
to
the
scriptures
They
teach
us
about
Jesus
Christ
and
His
gospel
the
magnitude
of
His
Atonement
and
our
Fathers
great
plan
of
happiness
and
redemption
Daily
immersion
in
the
word
of
God
is
crucial
for
spiritual
survival
especially
in
these
days
of
increasing
upheaval
As
we
feast
on
the
words
of
Christ
daily
the
words
of
Christ
will
tell
us
how
to
respond
to
difficulties
we
never
thought
we
would
face
We
can
also
hear
Him
in
the
temple
The
house
of
the
Lord
is
a
house
of
learning
There
the
Lord
teaches
in
His
own
way
There
each
ordinance
teaches
about
the
Savior
There
we
learn
how
to
part
the
veil
and
communicate
more
clearly
with
heaven
There
we
learn
how
to
rebuke
the
adversary
and
draw
upon
the
Lords
priesthood
power
to
strengthen
us
and
those
we
love
How
eager
each
of
us
should
be
to
seek
refuge
there
When
these
temporary
COVID
restrictions
are
lifted
please
schedule
regular
time
to
worship
and
serve
in
the
temple
Every
minute
of
that
time
will
bless
you
and
your
family
in
ways
nothing
else
can
Take
time
to
ponder
what
you
hear
and
feel
when
you
are
there
Ask
the
Lord
to
teach
you
how
to
open
the
heavens
to
bless
your
life
and
the
lives
of
those
you
love
and
serve
While
worshipping
in
the
temple
is
presently
not
possible
I
invite
you
to
increase
your
participation
in
family
history
including
family
history
research
and
indexing
I
promise
that
as
you
increase
your
time
in
temple
and
family
history
work
you
will
increase
and
improve
your
ability
to
hear
Him
We
also
hear
Him
more
clearly
as
we
refine
our
ability
to
recognize
the
whisperings
of
the
Holy
Ghost
It
has
never
been
more
imperative
to
know
how
the
Spirit
speaks
to
you
than
right
now
In
the
Godhead
the
Holy
Ghost
is
the
messenger
He
will
bring
thoughts
to
your
mind
which
the
Father
and
Son
want
you
to
receive
He
is
the
Comforter
He
will
bring
a
feeling
of
peace
to
your
heart
He
testifies
of
truth
and
will
confirm
what
is
true
as
you
hear
and
read
the
word
of
the
Lord
I
renew
my
plea
for
you
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
increase
your
spiritual
capacity
to
receive
personal
revelation
Doing
so
will
help
you
know
how
to
move
ahead
with
your
life
what
to
do
during
times
of
crisis
and
how
to
discern
and
avoid
the
temptations
and
the
deceptions
of
the
adversary
And
finally
we
hear
Him
as
we
heed
the
words
of
prophets
seers
and
revelators
Ordained
Apostles
of
Jesus
Christ
always
testify
of
Him
They
point
the
way
as
we
make
our
way
through
the
heartwrenching
maze
of
our
mortal
experiences
What
will
happen
as
you
more
intentionally
hear
hearken
and
heed
what
the
Savior
has
said
and
what
He
is
saying
now
through
His
prophets
I
promise
that
you
will
be
blessed
with
additional
power
to
deal
with
temptation
struggles
and
weakness
I
promise
miracles
in
your
marriage
family
relationships
and
daily
work
And
I
promise
that
your
capacity
to
feel
joy
will
increase
even
if
turbulence
increases
in
your
life
This
April

general
conference
is
our
time
to
commemorate
an
event
that
changed
the
world
As
we
anticipated
this
th
anniversary
of
Joseph
Smiths
First
Vision
the
First
Presidency
and
Council
of
the
Twelve
Apostles
wondered
what
we
might
do
to
commemorate
appropriately
this
singular
event
That
theophany
initiated
the
Restoration
of
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
and
ushered
in
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
We
wondered
if
a
monument
should
be
erected
But
as
we
considered
the
unique
historic
and
international
impact
of
that
First
Vision
we
felt
impressed
to
create
a
monument
not
of
granite
or
stone
but
of
wordswords
of
solemn
and
sacred
proclamationwritten
not
to
be
carved
in
tables
of
stone
but
rather
to
be
etched
in
the
fleshy
tables
of
our
hearts
Since
the
Church
was
organized
only
five
proclamations
have
been
issued
with
the
last
being
The
Family
A
Proclamation
to
the
World
presented
by
President
Gordon
B
Hinckley
in

Now
as
we
contemplate
this
significant
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
the
Lords
charge
to
gather
scattered
Israel
in
preparation
for
the
Second
Coming
of
Jesus
Christ
we
the
First
Presidency
and
Council
of
the
Twelve
Apostles
issue
the
following
proclamation
Its
title
is
The
Restoration
of
the
Fulness
of
the
Gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
A
Bicentennial
Proclamation
to
the
World
It
is
authored
by
the
First
Presidency
and
the
Council
of
the
Twelve
Apostles
of
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
It
is
dated
April

To
prepare
for
today
I
previously
recorded
this
proclamation
in
the
Sacred
Grove
where
Joseph
Smith
first
saw
the
Father
and
the
Son
We
solemnly
proclaim
that
God
loves
His
children
in
every
nation
of
the
world
God
the
Father
has
given
us
the
divine
birth
the
incomparable
life
and
the
infinite
atoning
sacrifice
of
His
Beloved
Son
Jesus
Christ
By
the
power
of
the
Father
Jesus
rose
again
and
gained
the
victory
over
death
He
is
our
Savior
our
Exemplar
and
our
Redeemer
Two
hundred
years
ago
on
a
beautiful
spring
morning
in

young
Joseph
Smith
seeking
to
know
which
church
to
join
went
into
the
woods
to
pray
near
his
home
in
upstate
New
York
USA
He
had
questions
regarding
the
salvation
of
his
soul
and
trusted
that
God
would
direct
him
In
humility
we
declare
that
in
answer
to
his
prayer
God
the
Father
and
His
Son
Jesus
Christ
appeared
to
Joseph
and
inaugurated
the
restitution
of
all
things
Acts

as
foretold
in
the
Bible
In
this
vision
he
learned
that
following
the
death
of
the
original
Apostles
Christs
New
Testament
Church
was
lost
from
the
earth
Joseph
would
be
instrumental
in
its
return
We
affirm
that
under
the
direction
of
the
Father
and
the
Son
heavenly
messengers
came
to
instruct
Joseph
and
reestablish
the
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
The
resurrected
John
the
Baptist
restored
the
authority
to
baptize
by
immersion
for
the
remission
of
sins
Three
of
the
original
twelve
ApostlesPeter
James
and
Johnrestored
the
apostleship
and
keys
of
priesthood
authority
Others
came
as
well
including
Elijah
who
restored
the
authority
to
join
families
together
forever
in
eternal
relationships
that
transcend
death
We
further
witness
that
Joseph
Smith
was
given
the
gift
and
power
of
God
to
translate
an
ancient
record
the
Book
of
MormonAnother
Testament
of
Jesus
Christ
Pages
of
this
sacred
text
include
an
account
of
the
personal
ministry
of
Jesus
Christ
among
people
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
soon
after
His
Resurrection
It
teaches
of
lifes
purpose
and
explains
the
doctrine
of
Christ
which
is
central
to
that
purpose
As
a
companion
scripture
to
the
Bible
the
Book
of
Mormon
testifies
that
all
human
beings
are
sons
and
daughters
of
a
loving
Father
in
Heaven
that
He
has
a
divine
plan
for
our
lives
and
that
His
Son
Jesus
Christ
speaks
today
as
well
as
in
days
of
old
We
declare
that
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
organized
on
April


is
Christs
New
Testament
Church
restored
This
Church
is
anchored
in
the
perfect
life
of
its
chief
cornerstone
Jesus
Christ
and
in
His
infinite
Atonement
and
literal
Resurrection
Jesus
Christ
has
once
again
called
Apostles
and
has
given
them
priesthood
authority
He
invites
all
of
us
to
come
unto
Him
and
His
Church
to
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
the
ordinances
of
salvation
and
to
gain
enduring
joy
Two
hundred
years
have
now
elapsed
since
this
Restoration
was
initiated
by
God
the
Father
and
His
Beloved
Son
Jesus
Christ
Millions
throughout
the
world
have
embraced
a
knowledge
of
these
prophesied
events
We
gladly
declare
that
the
promised
Restoration
goes
forward
through
continuing
revelation
The
earth
will
never
again
be
the
same
as
God
will
gather
together
in
one
all
things
in
Christ
Ephesians

With
reverence
and
gratitude
we
as
His
Apostles
invite
all
to
knowas
we
dothat
the
heavens
are
open
We
affirm
that
God
is
making
known
His
will
for
His
beloved
sons
and
daughters
We
testify
that
those
who
prayerfully
study
the
message
of
the
Restoration
and
act
in
faith
will
be
blessed
to
gain
their
own
witness
of
its
divinity
and
of
its
purpose
to
prepare
the
world
for
the
promised
Second
Coming
of
our
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
Beloved
brothers
and
sisters
that
is
our
bicentennial
proclamation
to
the
world
regarding
the
Restoration
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
in
its
fulness
It
has
been
translated
into

languages
Other
languages
will
soon
follow
It
will
be
available
immediately
on
the
Church
website
from
which
you
may
obtain
a
copy
Study
it
privately
and
with
your
family
members
and
friends
Ponder
the
truths
and
think
of
the
impact
those
truths
will
have
on
your
life
if
you
will
hear
them
hearken
to
them
and
heed
the
commandments
and
covenants
that
accompany
them
I
know
that
Joseph
Smith
is
the
foreordained
prophet
whom
the
Lord
chose
to
open
this
last
dispensation
Through
him
the
Lords
Church
was
restored
to
the
earth
Joseph
sealed
his
testimony
with
his
blood
How
I
love
and
honor
him
God
lives
Jesus
is
the
Christ
His
Church
has
been
restored
He
and
His
Father
our
Heavenly
Father
are
watching
over
us
I
so
testify
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amenLord
My
beloved
brothers
and
sisters
as
we
come
to
the
end
of
this
historic
conference
we
express
our
gratitude
to
the
Lord
The
music
has
been
sublime
and
the
messages
inspiring
During
this
conference
we
have
experienced
many
highlights
On
this
bicentennial
anniversary
we
have
introduced
a
proclamation
to
the
world
declaring
the
reality
of
the
Restoration
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
in
its
fulness
We
commemorated
the
Restoration
with
the
Hosanna
Shout
We
unveiled
a
new
symbol
signifying
our
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
for
visual
recognition
of
official
Church
information
and
materials
We
have
called
for
a
global
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
that
the
present
pandemic
may
be
controlled
caregivers
protected
the
economy
strengthened
and
life
normalized
This
fast
will
be
held
on
Good
Friday
April

What
a
great
Friday
that
will
be
Next
Sunday
is
Easter
Sunday
when
we
will
again
commemorate
the
Atonement
and
Resurrection
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Because
of
His
Atonement
His
gift
of
resurrection
will
come
to
all
who
have
ever
lived
And
His
gift
of
eternal
life
will
come
to
all
who
qualify
by
fidelity
to
ordinances
and
covenants
made
in
His
holy
temples
The
many
inspiring
components
of
this
April

general
conferenceand
the
sacred
week
that
we
now
begincan
be
summarized
by
two
divinely
decreed
words
Hear
Him
We
pray
that
your
focus
on
Heavenly
Father
who
spoke
those
words
and
on
His
Beloved
Son
Jesus
Christ
will
loom
largest
in
your
memories
of
all
that
has
transpired
We
pray
that
you
will
begin
anew
truly
to
hear
hearken
to
and
heed
the
words
of
the
Savior
I
promise
that
decreased
fear
and
increased
faith
will
follow
Thank
you
for
your
desire
to
make
your
homes
true
sanctuaries
of
faith
where
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
may
dwell
Our
gospel
study
curriculum
Come
Follow
Me
will
continue
to
bless
your
lives
Your
consistent
efforts
in
this
endeavoreven
during
those
moments
when
you
feel
that
you
are
not
being
particularly
successfulwill
change
your
life
that
of
your
family
and
the
world
We
will
be
strengthened
as
we
become
even
more
valiant
disciples
of
the
Lord
standing
up
and
speaking
up
for
Him
wherever
we
are
Now
lets
talk
about
temples
We
have

dedicated
temples
across
the
world
Others
are
at
various
stages
of
planning
and
construction
When
plans
are
announced
to
erect
a
new
temple
it
becomes
part
of
our
sacred
history
It
may
seem
odd
to
announce
new
temples
when
all
our
temples
are
closed
for
a
while
More
than
a
century
ago
President
Wilford
Woodruff
foresaw
conditions
such
as
ours
today
as
recorded
in
his
dedicatory
prayer
of
the
Salt
Lake
Temple
given
in

Some
of
you
may
have
recently
seen
excerpts
from
this
remarkable
prayer
on
social
media
Hear
these
pleadings
from
a
mighty
prophet
of
God
When
Thy
people
shall
not
have
the
opportunity
of
entering
this
holy
house

and
they
are
oppressed
and
in
trouble
surrounded
by
difficulties

and
shall
turn
their
faces
towards
this
Thy
holy
house
and
ask
Thee
for
deliverance
for
help
for
Thy
power
to
be
extended
in
their
behalf
we
beseech
Thee
to
look
down
from
Thy
holy
habitation
in
mercy

and
listen
to
their
cries
Or
when
the
children
of
Thy
people
in
years
to
come
shall
be
separated
through
any
cause
from
this
place

and
they
shall
cry
unto
Thee
from
the
depths
of
their
affliction
and
sorrow
to
extend
relief
and
deliverance
to
them
we
humbly
entreat
Thee
to

hearken
to
their
cries
and
grant
unto
them
the
blessings
for
which
they
ask
Brothers
and
sisters
during
times
of
our
distress
when
temples
are
closed
you
can
still
draw
upon
the
power
of
your
temple
covenants
and
endowment
as
you
honor
your
covenants
Please
use
this
time
when
temples
are
closed
to
continue
to
live
a
templeworthy
life
or
to
become
temple
worthy
Talk
about
the
temple
with
your
family
and
friends
Because
Jesus
Christ
is
at
the
center
of
everything
we
do
in
the
temple
as
you
think
more
about
the
temple
you
will
be
thinking
more
about
Him
Study
and
pray
to
learn
more
about
the
power
and
knowledge
with
which
you
have
been
endowedor
with
which
you
will
yet
be
endowed
Today
we
are
pleased
to
announce
plans
to
construct
eight
new
temples
in
the
following
locations
Baha
Blanca
Argentina
Tallahassee
Florida
Lubumbashi
Democratic
Republic
of
the
Congo
Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania
Benin
City
Nigeria
Syracuse
Utah
Dubai
United
Arab
Emirates
and
Shanghai
Peoples
Republic
of
China
In
all
eight
locations
Church
architects
will
work
with
local
officials
so
that
the
temple
will
harmonize
with
and
be
a
beautiful
addition
to
each
community
The
plan
for
a
temple
in
Dubai
comes
in
response
to
their
gracious
invitation
which
we
gratefully
acknowledge
Context
for
the
plan
for
Shanghai
is
very
important
For
more
than
two
decades
templeworthy
members
in
the
Peoples
Republic
of
China
have
attended
the
Hong
Kong
China
Temple
But
in
July

that
temple
was
closed
for
longplanned
and
muchneeded
renovation
In
Shanghai
a
modest
multipurpose
meeting
place
will
provide
a
way
for
Chinese
members
to
continue
to
participate
in
ordinances
of
the
templein
the
Peoples
Republic
of
Chinafor
them
and
their
ancestors
In
every
country
this
Church
teaches
its
members
to
honor
obey
and
sustain
the
law
We
teach
the
importance
of
the
family
of
being
good
parents
and
exemplary
citizens
Because
we
respect
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
Peoples
Republic
of
China
the
Church
does
not
send
proselyting
missionaries
there
nor
will
we
do
so
now
Expatriate
and
Chinese
congregations
will
continue
to
meet
separately
The
Churchs
legal
status
there
remains
unchanged
In
an
initial
phase
of
facility
use
entry
will
be
by
appointment
only
The
house
of
the
Lord
in
Shanghai
will
not
be
a
destination
place
for
tourists
from
other
countries
These
eight
new
temples
will
bless
the
lives
of
many
people
on
both
sides
of
the
veil
of
death
Temples
are
a
crowning
part
of
the
Restoration
of
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
In
Gods
goodness
and
generosity
He
is
bringing
the
blessings
of
the
temple
closer
to
His
children
everywhere
As
the
Restoration
continues
I
know
that
God
will
continue
to
reveal
many
great
and
important
things
pertaining
to
His
kingdom
here
on
earth
That
kingdom
is
The
Church
of
Jesus
Christ
of
Latterday
Saints
Dear
brothers
and
sisters
I
express
my
love
for
you
During
this
time
of
tension
and
uncertainty
and
invoking
the
authority
vested
in
me
I
would
like
to
confer
upon
you
an
apostolic
blessing
I
bless
you
with
peace
and
increasing
faith
in
the
Lord
I
bless
you
with
a
desire
to
repent
and
become
a
little
more
like
Him
each
day
I
bless
you
to
know
that
the
Prophet
Joseph
Smith
is
the
prophet
of
the
Restoration
of
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
in
its
fulness
Should
there
be
illness
among
you
or
your
loved
ones
I
leave
a
blessing
of
healing
consistent
with
the
will
of
the
Lord
I
so
bless
you
adding
once
more
my
expression
of
love
for
each
of
you
in
the
sacred
name
of
Jesus
Christ
amen
